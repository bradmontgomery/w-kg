# A Watts / Kg calculator

This simple app will calculate power for serveral _watts / kg zones_ based
on your current body weight (in lbs).

The original code was hastily thrown together in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/bkmontgomery/pen/dyXWeMJ).

**Note**: This was *intentionally* set up using the ["Quick try JSX"](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#quickly-try-jsx) technique, so it's not going to be super performant.
