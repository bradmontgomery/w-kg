# Project overview

This is a simple front-end application that contains various cycling-related (cycling as in bicycles) calculators. It is implemented in React with JavaScript/ECMAScript and uses vite.js (https://vite.dev/)

# Bash commands
- npm run dev: Run the developer server
- npm run build: Build the project
- npm run lint: Run eslint
- npm run preview: Run a preview server

# Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when you're done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
